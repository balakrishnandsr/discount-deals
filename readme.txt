== FEATURES ==

= Bulk Discount =
Create bulk discounts in three simple steps. The discount can be for the entire store / categories / products / attributes. It can also be based on the order total. You can create unlimited bulk discount workflows.

= Store-wide discount =
Offer a 10% discount across the store and go live within a few minutes. It just takes 2 steps to create a discount.

= Quantity based tiered discounts =
This is the same as the bulk discount. You can create tiered bulk discounts. Example: Buy 5 quantities, get 10%, Buy 6 to 10 quantities, get 20%, Buy 11 to 15 quantities, get 25%.

= Buy One and Get One offers =
Create any type of BOGO offers. The plugin supports Buy X Get X, Buy X Get Y types and also conditional BOGO offers like Buy product A and get 50% on cheapest in cart. So the discount can be either free or a limited percentage as well.

= Percentage discounts =
Both the price based and cart based workflows support percentage discounts. You can create any type of percentage based discounts including a conditional, dependent rule.

= Fixed discounts =
The fixed cost discount can be offered per product / category. You can also set up a fixed cost discount that applies to the entire cart.

= Discount for Product Variations =
You can configure a discount for a single variation or for multiple variations. You can also choose to provide a discount for one variant across products. Example: Blue color gets 10% discount.

= Attribute based discounts =
Offer discounts based on the product attributes (which were created using the WooCommerce Attributes and associated with the products).

= User role discount =
Discount workflows can be limited to specific user roles. Example: Wholesale customers get a 10% discount across the store / categories / attributes / cart.

= Free Shipping =
Offer free shipping to customers if they meet certain conditions. Example: Free shipping for orders over $500.

= Order total based discounts =
Create offers based on the total order value. Example: 5% discount for all orders above $1000.

= Shipping Address based discount =
Offer discount based on the shipping destination of the customers. Example: Customers from the US get a 10% discount. It could also be based on the zip/postal codes.

= Coupon activated discounts =
You can create a normal WooCommerce Coupon code and associate it with any discount workflows. So whenever that coupon is applied, the associated discount workflows will apply. This way, you can just activate multiple discount workflows with a single coupon code.

= Combo offers =
Club two or more product categories and create an advanced product combo discount. Buy One quantity of Product A and One quantity of Product B to get a $50 Flat Price discount.

= Purchase History Discounts =
Create discounts based on the purchase history of the customers. Example: 10% discount for all customers who have purchased for over $1000 in their previous orders.

= First Order discount =
Encourage first time customers to purchase with a coupon code and an associated discount rule, which checks if the customer has not made any previous purchases.

= Flexible Discount Display =
Use our advanced layout for the discount table to showcase the discount on product pages in the way you wanted. Use your own wordage instead of the built-in default texts. That way, you have a better control over what you express.

= Alerts =
Showcase an alert when the discount is applied at the cart page and bring a smile! People love when they receive a discount.

= You saved - text =
Show a “You Saved” text at the line item and/or the total column in cart and checkout. People love when they save money! Add more reasons for smiling and improve the checkout experience.
